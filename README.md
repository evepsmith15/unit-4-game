# unit-4-game
This game is similar to 21 where you try to get as close to the number the CPU picks while you don't go over the score.
The gem stones have randomly generated numbers until the player clicks on them. 
For an atmospheric experience, music is placed at the top of the header. The "fat Santa" taunts you on the right side of the screen meanwhile. 
When the player wins, a familiar emerald theme is played. When you lose, you will be laughed and mocked by someone outside of Santa. 

CSS messes around with the aesetic of the game. Black was the chosen theme due to give a nightime feel to the website. 

Javascript has the code for the game. 

UPDATE: 
I re-wrote the js script. I tried to use only one function but that meant the game wouldn't start or reconize the code for index. So I changed it to where more functions are used and call each other in order for the game to function. 

UPDATE 2: 
I was having problems with my github so my tutor was showing me how he did it on his share screen. This is why he is listed as a contributor. The game now functions.
